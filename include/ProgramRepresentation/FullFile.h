/* reflects a file. this class manages all the functions that make up a single
file. how everything in `ProgramRepresentation` is structured is as follows:

- a `FullFile` is composed of functions (`ProgramFunction` s) that the user declares.
- `ProgramFunction` s are composed of LLVM IR branches (`ProgramPoints` s)
- and these branches contain information mapping each variable (and any of its aliases)
to a set of methods called on them, which are the `DisjointPVAliasSets`.
- these disjoint sets are composed of `PVAliasSet` s, which holds a set of program variables
(typed `ProgramVariable`) which are must-aliases of each other, and the set of methods
called on them (typed `MethodSet`)
- `ProgramVariable` s are thus primitive objects that are isomorphic to the
set of variables seen in the user's C code (or LLVM IR code â€“ usually intermediate
variables)
- `MethodsSet` s are also primitive, simply being a container for a set of methods.
- the hierarchy may be "ordered" as follows:
`FullFile` > `ProgramFunction` > `ProgramPoint` > `PVAliasSet` > (`ProgramVariable, MethodsSet`)

(tasteless pedantry: here ">" is really just a left-associative binary relation saying that
"a > b" means a is composed of a set of b's.)
