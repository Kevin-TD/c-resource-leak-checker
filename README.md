# c-resource-leak-checker

This analysis runs with docker; here are the steps to setup the analysis: 

1. Clone the repo and set directory to the repo's 
2. Build the docker image:  ``docker build -t c-resource .``
3. Run docker in interactive mode: ``docker run -t c-resource -w /c-resource-leak-checker``
4. Run the following to get opt working: ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mirtk/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}```
5. Make (```mkdir build```) and set directory to build (```cd build```)
6. Build Clang, LLVM, other important stuff with ```cmake ..```

To run a pass test call ```python3 ../run_pt.py test_name``` for a test in the ./test directory. test_name is based on directory name. 
E.g., ```python3 ../run_pt.py simple_anno_test```
- See command line options by calling ```python3 ../run_pt.py --help```

To run an annotation test call ```python3 ../run_at.py test_name```
- See command line options by calling ```python3 ../run_at.py --help```

To run every pass test call ```python3 ../whole_test_run.py PassTestRunner Passes```
- Add ```--no-make```flag if your analysis is already built (optional, but it speeds up the analysis a bit)

To run every annotation test call ```python3 ../whole_test_run.py AnnotationTestRunner Annotations```
